# AI_CarbonEmission_Optimizer
AI-Powered Carbon Emission Optimizer This project is designed to predict and optimize carbon emissions using AI and Machine Learning. It helps industries and smart cities analyze CO₂ emissions based on input pollutants (CO &amp; CH₄) and suggests optimized values for reducing environmental impact.
Features
✅ AI-Based Prediction – Estimates CO₂ emissions using a trained machine learning model.
✅ Emission Optimization – Suggests ways to minimize emissions for sustainability.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple Flask-based web app for easy interaction.
✅ Error Handling – Validates inputs and provides clear error messages.
✅ Real-World Use Cases – Useful for factories, industries, and smart cities to monitor pollution.

🔧 Tech Stack
🔹 Python – Backend processing & AI model.
🔹 Flask – Web framework for API & frontend.
🔹 Joblib & Pandas – Model loading and data handling.
🔹 Machine Learning – Trained predictive model for CO₂ estimation.
